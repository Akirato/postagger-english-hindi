The design of this tokenizer is generic and can be used for any language.
I have test it throughly for Hindi. and gives good accuracy.

For Hindi we have generate the acronym list, we also some special symbols
and create a file <language>.acr in data directory.

To use it for your language you have put acronyms or tokens which you want to
avoide as sentence split or single token in data/<language>.acr file.

For help Hindi data are created by using "sample-acronym-data-hin" directory.



For Good Accurcy use input encoding as utf-8.
